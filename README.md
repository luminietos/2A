 # Train Schedule - JS Project 02A

## Description
This is a Finnish train station information app that that utilizes Live JSON API from Digitraffic. 
It is my second JS project and my first project using an API, made for my University's JavaScript course. On top of JS, it has CSS and HTML for the UI (layout & style). It was created in April 2022. 
You can find the site [here](https://luminietos.github.io/P02a/) (GitHub) or [here](https://62716c958bbe99005ca753f8--capable-sprinkles-cabbc2.netlify.app/) (Netlify).

## Step-by-step guide - *"How do I actually use this site?"*
There are two green containers with two different text fields.
In the first text field, the user types in a Finnish train station name's short-code (i.e. 'HKI' for 'Helsinki') text field. 
Once they've done this, they may click on the magnifying glass icon aka the search button, which will retrieve the search result for the user. 
Data regarding the station the user input will appear below.

Below this is the aforementioned second green container. It functions like the one above, only this one contains the raw, live data regarding the station the user types into the text field. The textarea expands on click, and will shrink back if the user clicks outside the text area (*unless* the text area already contains data from the user's input).

## Status
This project is complete for the foreseeable future. I may or may not come back to fix this at a later date.
